`lwt-node` is a safer, faster way to build systems/server applications.

By leveraging `reason`'s great type system, expressive language features,
`lwt-node` implements a node.js like API that is:

* Fast
* Safe and statically typed
* Simple and lean

The goal is to eventually reach feature parity with the node.js API.
These will be filled in incrementally as the API is smoothed out.
